This is a set of angular modules which are based on SEB's bootstrap theme.

```

Then make sure you add the Main SEB bootstrap package in your main style.SCSS or index.ts as follows

## Development

For `Visual Studio Code` users, please install the recommended project plugin

1. To run the project for development: `npm run docs`
2. To run the unit tests, run: `npm run test`

## Usage

To use a component, you need to import the `Module` in whichever Module you want to use it. For performance/stability benefits we are not combining all the components into single Index, rather they are chunk into their own sub packages, therefore to use a component, you need to import the `Component` sub-module from the `lib` folder, in whichever Class you want to use it. Here is a sample of how to import the `Chip` component in a page which you can then access by its selector.

```javascript
import { ChipModule } from "@sebgroup/ng-components/lib/Chip";
@NgModule({
      imports: [ChipModule]
})
export class YourModule { }

 <sebng-chip (onClose)="onClose($event)">Chip Text</sebng-chip>
```
