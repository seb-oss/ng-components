This is a set of angular components some of which are based on SEB's bootstrap. The plan for this project is to increase and improve components for future usage.

-   The package name: `@sebgroup/ng-components`
-   [Get started](https://sebgroup.github.io/ng-components/docs/getting-started)
-   The package documentation: [Documentation](https://sebgroup.github.io/ng-components)
-   The package sourcecode: [Github Source Code](https://github.com/sebgroup/ng-components)
-   NPM package: [@sebgroup/ng-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sebgroup/ng-components)

#### :rotating_light: NOTICE: `@sebgroup/ng-components` support has officially ended as of March 2023.

**What does this mean?**

The code will remain accessible on GitHub and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sebgroup/ng-components). This website will remain here indefinitely.

The project will be in an archived state, meaning that no new development can be made _unless_:

-   it is meant for fixing critical and common-case bugs on the already existing components

**Where do I go from here?**

Go Green! Visit the [official Green documentation](https://sebgroup.github.io/green/latest/chlorophyll) to get started with SEB's new design system.

## Minimum requirements

This version of components has been developed with:

-   Angular CLI `~10.0.1`
-   Typescript `~3.9.5`
-   SEB Bootstrap `^5.3.0`

## Installation

You should be able to install the NPM package.

```bash
npm install @sebgroup/ng-components@beta --save
```

This project is based on SEB Bootstrap which includes `fonts`, `colors` and `variables`, to make sure everything works fine, please install these dependencies on your project:

```bash
npm install @sebgroup/bootstrap --save
```

Then make sure you add the Main SEB bootstrap package in your main style.SCSS or index.ts as follows
`@import '~@sebgroup/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';`.

For `Visual Studio Code` users, please install the [recommended plugins](.vscode/extensions.json)

## Development

This project uses `prettier` for a more consistent (less annoying) coding.

1. Development: `npm start`
2. Check formatting rules, Compile components and Create Docs folder: `npm run build`
3. Build and create the Documentation pages only: `npm run docs`
4. To run the unit tests, run: `npm test`
5. To commit your changes run: `npm run commit` and follow the steps

## Usage

To use a component, you need to import the `Module` in whichever Module you want to use it. For performance/stability benefits we are not combining all the components into single Index, rather they are chunk into their own sub packages, therefore to use a component, you need to import the `Component` sub-module from the `lib` folder, in whichever Class you want to use it. Here is a sample of how to import the `Chip` component in a page which you can then access by its selector.

```javascript
import { ChipModule } from "@sebgroup/ng-components/lib/chip";

@NgModule({
      imports: [ChipModule]
})
export class YourModule { }

 <sebng-chip (onClose)="onClose($event)">Chip Text</sebng-chip>
```
